            <h2>Accessing Your Analytics Data</h2>
            <p>
                All user, player, and revenue-related events are now being tracked and sent to Firebase Analytics.
                You can view and analyze this data in your Firebase project console.
            </p>

            <h3>How to View Your Data:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Go to the Firebase Console:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Navigate to the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase Console</a> and select your project (<code>supergame-4aa29</code>).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Open the Analytics Dashboard:</strong>
                    <p>
                        In the left-hand menu, under the "Analytics" section, click on "Dashboard". This will give you a high-level overview of your user engagement, including active users, user retention, and more.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>View Custom Events:</strong>
                    <p>
                        To see the custom events we've set up (like <code>play_game</code>, <code>login</code>, etc.), go to the "Events" tab in the Analytics section. Here you will see a list of all tracked events and their counts. You can click on any event to see more detailed reporting, including the parameters we're tracking (like game name or login method).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use DebugView for Real-time Testing:</strong>
                    <p>
                        To see events in real-time as you test the website, use the "DebugView". You can find this at the bottom of the left-hand menu in the Analytics section. Events from your development machine should appear here within seconds, which is very useful for verifying that tracking is working correctly.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Key Events Being Tracked:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>login:</strong> When a user logs in with Facebook or Twitch.</li>
                <li><strong>play_game:</strong> When a user clicks a "Play Now" button.</li>
                <li><strong>sponsor_game:</strong> When a user clicks a "Sponsor this game" button.</li>
