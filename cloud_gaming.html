            <h2>Play High-End Games Anywhere with Cloud Streaming</h2>
            <p><strong>Our vision for Game Portal includes a Cloud Game Streaming feature, allowing you to play demanding PC and console games on various devices, streamed directly from powerful cloud servers.</strong></p>
            <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Please Note: This feature is currently in the planning and conceptual phase and is NOT yet functional. Implementation would likely involve partnerships with existing cloud gaming providers.</p>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h3>How Cloud Gaming Works (Conceptual)</h3>
            <p>Instead of running games on your local device, cloud gaming services run the game on high-performance servers in data centers. The game's video and audio are streamed to your device like a video, and your controller/keyboard inputs are sent back to the server in real-time.</p>
            <p>This could enable you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play graphically intensive games on lower-spec devices (laptops, tablets, phones).</li>
                <li>Access your game library without lengthy downloads or installations.</li>
                <li>Switch seamlessly between devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
            <p>Bringing cloud game streaming to Game Portal is a significant endeavor. It typically requires integration with established cloud gaming platforms, robust internet connectivity for users, and handling of subscriptions or game purchases through those platforms.</p>
            <p>This page serves as a placeholder to share our ambition for this feature. No cloud streaming services are currently active or accessible through Game Portal.</p>
