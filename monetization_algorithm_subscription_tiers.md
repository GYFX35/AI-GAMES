# Monetization Algorithm: Personalized Subscription Tier Recommendations

This document outlines the design of an algorithm to recommend the most suitable subscription tier to users on the Games Universe Platform. The core principle is to quantify and communicate the value each tier would provide to a user based on their specific behavior.

## The 5-Step Design

The algorithm is designed in five main parts, from defining the product to testing the recommendation strategy.

### 1. Subscription Tiers & Value Definition

A hypothetical three-tier structure is proposed as a foundation:

*   **Player Tier ($4.99/mo):** Access to a curated vault of older games and a 5% store discount.
*   **Pro Tier ($9.99/mo):** Access to a larger vault with newer AAA titles, 10-hour new release trials, and a 10% store discount.
*   **Elite Tier ($14.99/mo):** Includes everything from Pro, plus Day One access to first-party titles, included DLC, a monthly premium currency stipend, and a 15% store discount.

### 2. User Playstyle Identification

Users are categorized into behavioral profiles based on how they engage with content:

*   **The Loyalist:** Plays one game almost exclusively. Benefits most from DLC, currency, and Day One access (**Elite Tier**).
*   **The Sampler:** Plays a wide variety of games. Benefits most from a large game catalog (**Pro Tier**).
*   **The Economist:** Focuses on purchasing full games and building a library. Benefits most from the store discount (**Player/Pro Tier**).
*   **The In-Game Spender:** Makes frequent microtransaction purchases. Benefits most from the monthly premium currency stipend (**Elite Tier**).

### 3. Tier-Matching Logic

The algorithm recommends the tier with the highest **Net Value**.

*   **Formula:** `Net Value = (Total Calculated Monthly Value) - (Monthly Tier Cost)`
*   **Value Calculation:** The system analyzes a user's past 30 days of activity to calculate the monetary value they *would have* received from each tier's benefits (e.g., value of games played from the vault, value of store discounts, value of currency stipend).

### 4. Promotion Triggers & Messaging

The system suggests a subscription at key moments with personalized messaging.

*   **Triggers:** Post-purchase screens, session summaries, a dynamic store banner, or when a user's activity makes a subscription a particularly high-value proposition.
*   **Messaging:** The promotional copy is tailored to the user's playstyle, highlighting the most relevant benefits. For example, a "Sampler" is told how many games they could have played for free, while an "Economist" is told how much money they would have saved.

### 5. Full Algorithm & A/B Testing

The system is split into two parts for implementation:

*   **Recurring Batch Process:** A nightly job that re-calculates each user's `playstyle` and the potential `value` of each tier, caching the results.
*   **Real-Time Process:** When a trigger fires, the system uses the pre-calculated data to determine the recommendation and display the personalized message.
*   **A/B Testing:** A framework is proposed to continuously test different messaging strategies, recommendation logic, and triggers to optimize for conversion rate and revenue while protecting user retention.
