            <h2>How PWAs are Typically Accessed</h2>
            <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) like Game Portal are designed to be easily accessible directly from your web browser. You can often "install" them by adding them to your device's home screen. This installation process itself is generally free and doesn't involve a traditional app store purchase for access from the web.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="monetization-strategies">
            <h2>Monetization Strategies for Game Portal (Future Vision)</h2>
            <p>While direct paid "downloads" from the web are not standard for PWAs, there are several ways Game Portal could be monetized in the future:</p>

            <div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin-top: 15px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
                <h4>1. App Store Distribution</h4>
                <p>It's possible to package PWAs for distribution through traditional app stores (e.g., Google Play Store using Trusted Web Activities - TWA, or the Microsoft Store). If Game Portal were offered through an app store:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It could potentially be listed as a paid app, where users pay a one-time fee to download it from the store.</li>
                    <li>The app store would handle the payment collection from users (who might use methods like Google Pay, credit cards, etc., as supported by the store).</li>
                    <li>The app store would then pay out the collected revenue (minus their commission) to the app owner's linked bank account.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin-top: 25px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
                <h4>2. In-App Monetization (Premium Features or Content)</h4>
                <p>Another common approach is to offer the base PWA for free, but include optional premium features, content, or subscriptions that users can purchase from within the app. Examples could include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to exclusive games or game levels.</li>
                    <li>Ad-free experience.</li>
                    <li>Virtual currency or items.</li>
                    <li>Subscription for ongoing access to premium content.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Implementing this would require:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A secure backend system to manage user entitlements and process payments.</li>
                    <li>Integration with a payment processor (like Stripe, Braintree, Adyen) that can handle transactions, including those made via Google Pay or other card payments.</li>
                    <li>The payment processor would transfer the collected funds to the app owner's bank account.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="owner-payments">
            <h2>How the App Owner Gets Paid</h2>
            <p>In either of the scenarios above (app store sales or in-app monetization), the app owner does not directly handle users' sensitive payment details like credit card numbers. Instead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For app store sales, the app store manages the entire transaction and remits earnings to the owner.</li>
                <li>For in-app purchases, a third-party payment processor securely handles the transaction and deposits funds to the owner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google Pay, in these contexts, is a payment method that users can select at the point of sale (either in the app store or within the app via the payment processor). The funds are then routed through these intermediaries before reaching the app owner.</p>
