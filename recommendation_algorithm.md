# Content-Based Recommendation Algorithm for a Games Platform

This document outlines the design of a content-based recommendation algorithm for a "Games Universe Platform". The algorithm recommends games to users based on the features of games they have previously shown interest in.

## The 5-Step Design

The design process is broken down into five main steps:

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

**Goal:** To create a single, unified text field for each game that contains all its important descriptive features. This is called the "feature soup."

**Process:**
1.  **Select Key Features:** `Genre`, `Tags`, `Developer`, `Publisher`.
2.  **Clean and Standardize:** Make all text lowercase and remove spaces from multi-word terms (e.g., "Open World" becomes "openworld") to treat them as single entities.
3.  **Combine:** For each game, concatenate the cleaned features into a single space-separated string.

**Example:** A game with Genre "RPG" and Tag "OpenWorld" would have a feature soup like `"rpg openworld ..."`.

### Step 2: Vectorization

**Goal:** To convert the textual "feature soup" strings into numerical vectors that a machine can process.

**Process:**
1.  **Use `CountVectorizer`:** This tool scans all feature soups to build a master vocabulary of all unique terms.
2.  **Create Vectors:** For each game, a vector is created. The vector's length is the size of the master vocabulary. A `1` is placed at the position of each term present in the game's feature soup, and `0` otherwise.

**Example:** If the vocabulary is `['action', 'openworld', 'rpg']`, a game with soup `"rpg openworld"` would have the vector `[0, 1, 1]`.

### Step 3: Similarity Calculation

**Goal:** To calculate a precise "similarity score" between every pair of games.

**Process:**
1.  **Use Cosine Similarity:** This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. A score of 1 means they are identical; 0 means they are completely different. It effectively measures how similar the games' features are.
2.  **Create a Similarity Matrix:** A square matrix is computed where both rows and columns represent the games. The cell at `(row_i, column_j)` contains the cosine similarity score between `Game i` and `Game j`. This matrix is pre-computed and stored for fast lookups.

### Step 4: Construct the Recommendation Function

**Goal:** To create a function that takes a game title and returns a list of the most similar games.

**Logic:**
1.  **Input:** `get_recommendations(game_title, num_recommendations)`
2.  **Find Index:** Look up the index of the `game_title`.
3.  **Get Scores:** Retrieve the corresponding row from the similarity matrix.
4.  **Sort:** Sort the scores in descending order to find the games with the highest similarity.
5.  **Return Titles:** Exclude the input game itself and return the titles of the top `num_recommendations`.

### Step 5: Path to Personalization

**Goal:** To recommend games based on a user's entire taste profile, not just a single game.

**Process:**
1.  **Create a User Taste Profile:**
    *   Get the user's history of highly-rated games.
    *   Create a weighted average of the vectors of these games, using the ratings as weights. This results in a single "taste profile vector" for the user.
2.  **Generate Recommendations:**
    *   Calculate the cosine similarity between the user's taste profile vector and all game vectors.
    *   Sort the results and return the top games the user hasn't interacted with before.
